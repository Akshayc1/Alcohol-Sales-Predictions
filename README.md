# Alcohol-Sales-Predictions

The main aim is developing the model for alcohol sales prediction which would be able to predict the amount of alcohol sold out in terms of its price or sale. So given data through the database, the model will be able to recognize the patterns intelligently and without the interference of human intelligence or human interaction.

The model can be also helpful for giving the recommendation for the owner of the liquor shop to increase the sales of the alcohol.
